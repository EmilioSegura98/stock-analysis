### Advantages
The advantages of this code is the level of efficiency and how fast it runs over the information, One disadvantage 
is that I don't find it usable for the stock market since the information changes a lot and it will need to 
be complemented by other code that retrieves the live information day to day so that the input is better as itÂ´s
shown in platforms like yahoo finance.
